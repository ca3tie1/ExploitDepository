description: SitePlayer is an embedded ethernet HTTP server designed to easily and
  inexpensively web enable any microprocessor-based device. SitePlayer Telnet is an
  RS232 to Ethernet protocol converter. It allows you to connect legacy RS232 devices
  to The Internet by providing a TCP/IP telnet session to an RS232 port. There are
  many devices which can only be controlled via RS232. With SitePlayer you can now
  control these devices through The Internet.
